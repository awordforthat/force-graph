#Force Graph Demo

This project is an exploration of 3D graphing. This graph attempts to dynamically lay out nodes in a tree structure such that they don't overlap or get close to any other nodes in the tree. Each node is allowed one parent and any number of children. Nodes expereince an attractive force towards their parents and a repulsive force towards any other node within a certain radius of them. 

## Using the demo
Click on any node to select it, then click the "Spawn Child" button to spawn a child of that node. 

## UI controls

The UI needs some work, but it does have the following basic controls:
* Zoom camera: Up/down arrows
* Rotate camera: Left/right arrows
* Click on node: select

## Development
This project was built with Unity 2019.4.2f1.
